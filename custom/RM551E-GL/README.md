# For preping a firmware before capture of the mtd block

This directory is for custom firmware development. It contains special versions of ipks intended to be installed as apart of a custom firmware.

This is mostly here to help me simplify the firmware creation process

R01 is for R01 firmware on OpenWRT 22.03.5
R02 is for R02 firmware on OpenWRT 23.05.4
